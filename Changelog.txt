    151. Overwhelm
    152. Corporate expansion
    153. Hostile takeover[/spoiler]


    Miscellaneous:

    [spoiler]AP Resolutions: Declare War (on a non-member), Force Peace (between two members), Religious victory, and Assign City are no longer eligible resolution actions.

    Fail-gold: You never get fail-gold if you also completed the wonder somewhere else (so no National Wonder fail-gold, or doubling up on a wonder to guarantee yourself a paycheck. The game still informs you that you received "0 gold" from your hammers).

    Hut techs: Can only gain techs from the first three rows of the tech screen:

    Fishing, Sailing, Wheel, Pottery, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Hunting, Archery, Mysticism, Masonry, Priesthood, Mining, Bronze Working, Writing.

    Toroidal maps: Now return city maintenance as if the map were Cylindrical.

    Maximum number of players is now 40, up from 18.

    Circumnavigation requires 55% water on the map, otherwise it is disabled. Circumnavigation is no longer a "First to" bonus, but will grant +1 movement to naval units to each player as they individually navigate the map and complete the necessary conditions.[/spoiler]

    BUG integration
    [spoiler]BUG fully integrated
    New BUG feature "Grid for graphs"
    New BUG feature improved Active advisor screen[/spoiler]

    Included additional bug fixes:

    [spoiler]Trade route turn order bug.

    Foreign trade route cities lost permanently when your city using those routes is destroyed (fix is taken from BTS unofficial patch).

    Build culture double production.

    Build wealth/research/culture + production automation double production.

    Proposed trades including cities, where the cities no longer exist to be trades, are not cancelled (note: I consider this a bug because proposed trades are already cancelled if a player lacks the requisite e.g. resources/gold. could be considered not a bug).

    Production decay counter on a type of build (e.g. axeman) is not reset after completing one if the next item in the queue is of the same type (fix is taken from BTS unofficial patch).

    Feature growth/disappearance rates, and bonus discovery (mine pop) rates, do not scale with game speed.

    Diplomacy Pausing: Diplomacy windows do not occur on game login whilst the game is paused.

    Autosaves: Autosaves are generated at login and log out; log out saves are saved to a folder specified within the global defines XML file. Default location is C:\temp.

    Additional alterations have been made to enable hosting of games on the pitboss server belonging to Zulan. These changes are detailed here[/spoiler]

    Added bugfixes from Unoffical Patch https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/unofficial-patch-for-3-19.324024/:

[spoiler]CvCity::init - Building a city on floodplains no longer removes floodplains, they'll still be there if city is destroyed (from Mongoose SDK)

    CvGameTextMgr (many places) - Fixed issues where unhappiness and unhealthiness from civics or buildings would incorrectly show up as -(unhappy face) instead of +(unhappy face) in several circumstances. (Thanks EmporerFool, Grave, Afforess)

    CvPlayerAI::AI_getHappinessWeight - Fixed bug for mods where civics with negative happiness effects from troops, largest cities, or war weariness were evaluated incorrectly
    CvPlayerAI::AI_bestPlotEspionage - relevant weights are 0, +- 50, +- 100, so comparison for Agg AI should be < 51 instead of < 50
    CvPlayerAI::AI_changePeacetimeTradeValue and CvPlayerAI::AI_changePeacetimeGrantValue - AIs you haven't met yet will no longer get angry at you for trading with their worst enemy (thanks Sephi)
    CvPlayerAI::AI_doDiplo - Fixed issue where team is sneak attack ready but hasn't declared war, AI would still demand tribute. If other team accepted, it blocked war declaration for 10 turns but AI still launched invasion and was then bounced when it could eventually declare.
    CvPlayerAI::AI_getStrategyHash - Fixed incorrect counting of destroyers as mobile anti-air

    CvTeam::addTeam - Fixed bug where, if civs A and B join in a permanent alliance, they get the max of A and B's espionage points against C but C just keeps its point against A and loses its points to B if that's higher
    CvTeam::shareCounters - Fixed bug in permanent alliances when No Tech Brokering is turned on, where a civ would often become unable to trade a tech they had researched after entering a permanent alliance.
    CvTeamAI::AI_doWar - use bFinancesProLimitedWar for limited war calc instead of max war version
    CvTeamAI::AI_calculateAreaAIType - Fixed incorrect index usage (thanks cephalo)
